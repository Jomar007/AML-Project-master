The test is performed by modifying the file AgreementMakerLight/src/aml/Test.java. The ontology names, the reference file name, and the output file name must be updated.

The program worked when executed in Eclipse.

In the file AgreementMakerLight/store/config.ini, the following lines was added:

#Standardization (options: none, standard, LA)
standardization=LA

If you want to run it with AML's original standardizations, change the line to:

standardization=standard

To use the lexical analyzers, the following files were included:
AgreementMakerLight/src/aml/ontology/regex_human.java
AgreementMakerLight/src/aml/ontology/regex_mouse.java
